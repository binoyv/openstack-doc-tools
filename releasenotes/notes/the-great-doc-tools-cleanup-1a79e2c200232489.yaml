upgrade:
  - |
    The `autogenerate_config_docs` set of tools has been removed. These were
    always buggy and hard to maintain, and they have been superseded by the
    ``oslo_config.sphinxext`` `Sphinx extension`__.

    The ``openstack-auto-commands`` command and its helper script in
    ``bin/doc-tools-update-cli-reference`` have been removed. These have been
    superseded by the ``cliff.sphinxext`` `Sphinx extensions`__.
